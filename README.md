# USB Device Control Tool

**Description**: The USB Device Control Tool is a Python-based utility designed for monitoring, blocking, and unblocking USB devices. This project was created by a student as part of a coursework or personal learning initiative to explore practical applications of Python in system administration and security. 

# Features
- **USB Monitoring**: Detects when USB devices are connected or disconnected from the system.
- **Device Control**: Allows blocking and unblocking of USB devices.
- **Metasploit Integration**: Interfaces with the Metasploit Framework to generate payloads and launch exploits via USB devices.
